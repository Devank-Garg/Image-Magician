## Augmentation is the action or process of making or becoming greater in size or amount. ##

## Image Augmentation is the process of generating new images for training our deep learning model. These new images are generated using the existing training images and hence we donâ€™t have to collect them manually. ##

### Various techniques can be used for image augmentation to feed input the model such as : ###

## Spatial augmentation

* Scaling
* Cropping
* Flipping
* Rotation
* Translation
## Pixel augmentation

* Brightness
* Contrast
* Saturation
* Hue

## In this Tkinter App I have implemented all the above features to make this hectic task easier
